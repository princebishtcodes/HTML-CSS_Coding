            <p>
                When you style a webpage, sometimes multiple CSS rules target the same
                element. So, which one wins? 🤔 That’s where CSS specificity comes in.
                It’s basically a weight system that determines which rule has more
                power. The higher the specificity, the stronger the rule - and the
                browser applies it.
            </p>
            <h2>Cascade Algorithm</h2>
            <p>
                CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheets. The cascade is the algorithm for
                solving conflicts where multiple CSS rules apply to an HTML element.
                It's the reason that the text of the button styled with the above CSS
                will be darkred.
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding the cascade algorithm helps you understand how the
                browser resolves conflicts like this. The cascade algorithm has 4
                distinct stages.

            <ol>
                <li><b>Position and order of appearance: </b>the order in which your CSS rules appear</li>
                <li><b>Specificity:</b> an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match (inline
                    &gt; ID &gt; class > element > universal)</li>
                <li><b>Origin:</b> the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser
                    style, CSS
                    from a browser extension, or your authored CSS
                </li>
                <li><b>Importance:</b> some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the
                    !important rule type</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
            <h2>Scientific Calculation</h2>
            To calculate specificity, assign a value to each part of the selector:
            <pre>
    Universal Selector: 0
    Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1
    Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10
    ID selectors: 100
    Inline styles: 1000
            </pre>
            Then add all this up to get total Specificity.
            </p>

    </main>
