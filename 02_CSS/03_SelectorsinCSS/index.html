      <h2>What Are CSS Selectors?</h2>
      <p>
        CSS selectors are patterns used to target specific HTML elements so you
        can apply styles to them. They tell the browser which elements your CSS
        should affect. Selectors are the foundation of CSS because without them,
        you wouldn’t know where your styles are being applied. Every selector
        points to one or more elements, and then the CSS rules inside the braces
        decide how those elements should look.

      <h2>Element Selectors</h2>
      <p>Class selectors target any element that has a specific class name. Since classes can be used multiple times on a page, they are ideal for styling groups of elements that share the same design, such as buttons, cards, or form fields. They are flexible and commonly used in almost every website.</p>
