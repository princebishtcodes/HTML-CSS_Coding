            <h2>Text and Fonts in CSS</h2>
            <p>CSS text and font properties are used to control how written content appears on a webpage. While HTML only defines the structure of text, CSS determines how that text looks, feels, and reads. Proper use of these properties improves readability, visual hierarchy, and overall user experience, making the content more attractive and easier to understand.</p>
            <h2>Font Properties</h2>
            <p>Font properties in CSS define the appearance of the text itself. The font-family property is used to choose the typeface, such as Arial, Times New Roman, or custom web fonts. Developers usually provide multiple font names as fallbacks in case a font is unavailable. The font-size property controls how large the text appears, and it can be set using pixels, em units, rem units, or percentages. The font-weight property adjusts the thickness of the text, such as normal, bold, or numeric values like 400 or 700, while font-style is used to apply styles like italic or normal.</p>
            <h2>Text Properties</h2>
            <p>Text properties focus on the layout and alignment of text content. The color property changes the text color, while text-align controls horizontal alignment, such as left, center, right, or justify. The line-height property adjusts the vertical spacing between lines of text, which is crucial for readability, especially in paragraphs. The letter-spacing and word-spacing properties control the space between characters and words, helping improve clarity or achieve specific design styles.</p>

                <h2>What are Colors in CSS?</h2>
                <p>Text properties focus on the layout and alignment of text content. The color property changes the text color, while text-align controls horizontal alignment, such as left, center, right, or justify. The line-height property adjusts the vertical spacing between lines of text, which is crucial for readability, especially in paragraphs. The letter-spacing and word-spacing properties control the space between characters and words, helping improve clarity or achieve specific design styles.</p>
                <h2>Ways to Add Colors in CSS</h2>
                <p>CSS provides multiple ways to define colors. The simplest method is using color names like red, blue, or green, which are easy to read but limited in variety. Hexadecimal color codes are widely used and allow precise color selection using a combination of red, green, and blue values, such as #ff0000 for red. RGB values define colors using red, green, and blue components with numeric values, while RGBA adds an alpha channel to control transparency. Another method is HSL, which defines colors based on hue, saturation, and lightness, making it easier to adjust brightness and intensity. These different color formats give developers flexibility to design visually balanced and accessible websites.</p>
