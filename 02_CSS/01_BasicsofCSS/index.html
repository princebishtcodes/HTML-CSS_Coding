        <h2>What is CSS ?</h2>
        <p>
          CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the language used to control the
          appearance of HTML elements on a webpage. While HTML provides the
          structure of the content, CSS is responsible for styling that
          content-such as colors, fonts, spacing, sizes, layouts, and visual
          effects. CSS separates design from structure, making it easier to
          maintain and update the look of a website without changing the HTML
          itself. It allows developers to create visually appealing websites
          that work across different devices and screen sizes.

        <h2>Ways to Apply CSS in HTML</h2><p>
          There are three main ways to use CSS in a webpage. Inline CSS involves writing style rules directly inside an HTML tag, but this method is not recommended for larger projects. Internal CSS is placed inside a style element in the head section of the HTML file and is suitable for styling a single page. The best method is external CSS, where a separate stylesheet file is linked to the HTML page. This keeps the code clean and allows the same stylesheet to style multiple pages, making the website easy to manage.

        <h3>Selectors in CSS</h3>
        <p>Selectors are used to target specific HTML elements so that styles can be applied to them. The simplest selector is the element selector, which targets all tags of a certain type, such as all paragraphs. Class selectors target elements that share a specific class name, making them useful for styling groups of elements. ID selectors target a single element with a unique ID, making them useful when one specific item needs special styling. There are also advanced selectors like attribute selectors, pseudo-class selectors, and pseudo-element selectors, which allow for more precise styling and interactions.</p>

        <h3>Box Model in CSS</h3>
        <p>The CSS box model is a fundamental concept that explains how every element on a webpage is treated as a rectangular box. It consists of four layers: content, padding, border, and margin. Padding is the space inside the element around the content, borders wrap around the padding, and margins create space outside the element between it and other elements. Understanding the box model is essential because it affects layout, spacing, and alignment. Without this knowledge, elements may not appear where you expect them to on the page.</p>

        <h3>Importance in Web Development</h3>
        <p>CSS is essential because it transforms plain HTML into visually engaging web pages. It allows developers to separate design from structure, making websites easier to maintain and scale. With responsive techniques like media queries and grids, CSS ensures websites look good on all screen sizes, from phones to desktops. Without CSS, webpages would be dull, unorganized, and difficult to navigate.</p>
