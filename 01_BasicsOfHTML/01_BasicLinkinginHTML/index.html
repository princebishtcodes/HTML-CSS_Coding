    <h1><u>Linking CSS and JS in HTML</u></h1>
    <p>Linking CSS and JavaScript to an HTML file is what brings style and interactivity to a webpage. CSS is typically linked inside the "head" section using the "link" tag, which connects an external stylesheet to your HTML. This allows the browser to load and apply all your styling rules before rendering the page. JavaScript is usually linked at the bottom of the "body" using the "script" tag so that the HTML content loads first and the script runs afterward, preventing slow or blocked page rendering. You can also place scripts in the "head" with the defer attribute to ensure they load in the background and execute only after the HTML is fully parsed. By properly linking CSS and JS, you separate structure, design, and functionality, making your code cleaner, faster, and easier to maintain as your website grows.</p>
