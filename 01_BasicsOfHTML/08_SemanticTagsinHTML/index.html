        <h1><u>Semantic Tags in HTML</u></h1>
        <p>
          Semantic tags in HTML are elements that clearly describe the meaning
          and purpose of the content they contain, making a webpage more
          organized, readable, and meaningful for both users and browsers. Tags
          like header, nav, main, section, article, aside, and footer tell the
          browser what role each part of the page plays, instead of using
          generic divs everywhere. This helps search engines understand the
          structure of the content better, improves SEO, and makes the page more
          accessible for screen readers. Semantic tags also make the code
          cleaner and easier for developers to maintain, as the layout and
          intention of each section becomes instantly clear. Overall, semantic
          tags improve the structure, clarity, and usability of a webpage while
          following modern web standards.

        <h2>Commonly used Semantic Tags</h2>
        <p>
          Semantic tags add meaning to your HTML. They tell both the browser and
          the developer what kind of content is being presented. Here are some
          of the key semantic tags you must know about: header: Used to
          represent the top section of a web page, often containing headings,
          logos, and navigation. nav: Signifies a navigation menu on a web page.
          article: Indicates a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog
          post or news article. section: Represents a thematic grouping of
          content on a web page. aside: Typically used for sidebars or content
          that is tangentially related to the main content. footer: Represents
          the footer of a web page, usually containing copyright information and
          contact details. figure and figcaption: Used for embedding images,
          diagrams, or charts, along with a caption. main: Signifies the main
          content area of a web page. time: Used to represent time-related
          information, like dates and times.
