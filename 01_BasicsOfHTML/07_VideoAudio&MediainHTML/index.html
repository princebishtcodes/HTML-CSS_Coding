    <h1><u>Video, Audio and Media in HTML</u></h1>
    <h2>Video Tag</h2>
    <p>The video tag in HTML is used to embed video files directly into a webpage without relying on external plugins. It allows you to display MP4, WebM, or other supported video formats and provides controls such as play, pause, volume, and fullscreen so users can interact with the video easily. The tag supports helpful attributes like controls to show the playback bar, autoplay to start the video automatically, loop to repeat it, and muted for videos that need to play silently.</p>
    <p><video height="300" src="video.mp4" controls >Apna </video></p>
    <p>You can also specify width and height to control the video’s size. Inside the video tag, source elements are used to link the actual video file, allowing the browser to choose the best compatible format. Overall, the video tag makes it simple and efficient to add multimedia content to a webpage, improving user experience without requiring additional software.</p>
    <h2>Audio Tag</h2>
    <p>The audio tag in HTML is used to embed sound files directly into a webpage so users can play music, voice recordings, podcasts, or sound effects without needing any external plugins. It supports formats like MP3, WAV, and OGG, and includes useful attributes such as controls, which displays the play and pause buttons, autoplay to start playback automatically, loop to repeat the audio, and muted for silent playback when needed.</p>
    <p><audio src="Mehrama.mp3" controls></audio></p>
    <p>Inside the audio tag, you place a source element that tells the browser where the audio file is located and what type it is. The audio tag makes adding sound to a website simple and efficient, allowing developers to enhance user experience with background music, notifications, or spoken content.</p>
