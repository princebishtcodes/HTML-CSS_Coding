    <h1><u>Working of HTML and Website</u></h1>
    <h3>How does HTML work?</h3>
    <p>A website works by combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but HTML is the foundation that everything else is built on. When you open a webpage, the browser sends a request to a server, which responds with an HTML file. The browser then reads that HTML from top to bottom, converting each tag into a structure called the DOM (Document Object Model) - a tree-like representation of every element on the page. Once the DOM is created, the browser fetches and applies CSS to style the elements, and then executes JavaScript to add interactivity. HTML itself doesn’t control visuals or behavior-its job is to define meaning and structure: what is a heading, a paragraph, an image, a button, a section, etc. As the browser processes this structure, it also loads external files like images, stylesheets, and scripts. Every change you make with JavaScript is actually a modification to the DOM that originated from HTML.</p>
    <p>In short, HTML is the skeleton of the website, CSS is the skin and design, JavaScript is the brain, and the browser is the machine that interprets all three to render a functional webpage.</p>
    <h3>How does a Website Works?</h3>
    <p>A website works through a series of fast, coordinated steps between your browser and a remote server. When you type a URL or click a link, your browser first asks the DNS (Domain Name System) to translate the domain name (like google.com) into an IP address - the actual location of the server on the internet. Once the browser has the IP address, it sends an HTTP or HTTPS request to that server asking for the webpage. The server receives the request, processes it, and sends back the necessary files - usually HTML first, then CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts, etc. Your browser then reads the HTML and builds the DOM, attaches CSS to create the render tree, and runs JavaScript to make the page interactive. This entire cycle of requesting, receiving, parsing, rendering, and executing often happens in milliseconds. Modern websites also optimize this process using caching, CDNs (Content Delivery Networks), compression, and async loading to make pages load faster. In simple terms: your browser requests → server responds → browser builds the page → JavaScript adds functionality → the final website appears on your screen.</p>
    <p>A website works through a simple client–server model where your browser is the client and the server is the machine storing the website’s data. When you type a URL, the browser first contacts the DNS to find the server’s IP address, then sends an HTTP or HTTPS request to that server. The server receives this request, processes it, and sends back a response that includes an HTTP status code. A code 200 means the request was successful and the browser will receive the webpage files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and more. If there’s a problem, the server returns error codes such as 404 Not Found when a page doesn’t exist, 403 Forbidden when access is denied, or 500 Internal Server Error when something goes wrong on the server side. After getting a successful response, the browser reads the HTML and turns it into the DOM structure, applies CSS to style the page, and runs JavaScript to add interactivity. This entire cycle of requesting, receiving, and rendering happens extremely fast and is what makes a website appear and function on your screen.
