    <h1><u>BoilerPlate and Importance of HTML</u></h1>
    <p>This is the Basic Structure of the HTML Code. It can easily be accessed by using (!) Exclaimation Mark and Pressing Enter.</p>
    <p>HTML isn’t just the “structure language” people call it-understanding how it actually works gives you long-term advantages as you move into CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks. The biggest fact most beginners ignore is that HTML is semantic, meaning tags like header, nav, main, section, and article carry meaning for browsers, SEO, and screen readers, not just layout.</p>
    <p>Proper semantics improves accessibility, search ranking, and even helps CSS target elements more predictably. Another useful fact is that HTML is parsed top-down, so where you place your script tags affects performance-putting them before body often speeds up page load. You should also know that browsers create a DOM tree based on your HTML, and every single thing you do in JS or CSS manipulates that tree. Even whitespace and invalid nesting can change how the DOM is constructed.</p>
    <p>Finally, HTML is extremely forgiving-browsers “fix” broken code silently-so your page might work even when your structure is wrong. This is why writing clean, semantic, valid HTML gives you fewer bugs later when you add CSS and JavaScript. Understanding these fundamentals early will save you hours of debugging as you become a full web developer.</p>
